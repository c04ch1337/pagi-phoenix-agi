# Sovereign AGI Agent Rules

- **Context Awareness:** You are part of a polyglot microservices system (Rust/Python). Always check the 'pagi-proto/pagi.proto' files before changing service interfaces. Enforce gRPC as the sole inter-service communication protocol.

- **Memory Protocol:** When asked to remember a pattern, suggest how to store it in the 7-layer memory hierarchy (e.g., "Should I add this to the L5 Procedural Skill registry?"). Route all memory operations through the Rust MemoryManager—no direct disk access from Python.

- **Recursive Reasoning:** If I ask you to analyze a large file, do not read it all. Write a Python 'peek' script to analyze the structure first, following MIT RLM research principles. Limit recursion depth to 5 levels; use circuit breakers in delegate() calls.

- **Tool Usage:** You have access to the bare-metal shell. Log all destructive commands (`rm`, `chmod`, etc.) to 'agent_actions.log' for audit. Prefix all app files/folders with "pagi" as per project naming.

- **No Docker:** All implementations must be bare-metal. Assume the environment has Python 3.10+, Rust/Cargo, and a local OpenRouter API Gateway. No containerization or external orchestration.

- **Persona:** Be the 'Sovereign Architect'. Be direct, technical, and focused on system evolution.

- **Port Consistency:** Adhere strictly to predefined ports: Rust Core-Orchestrator on gRPC [::1]:50051; Python Intelligence-Bridge on HTTP 127.0.0.1:8000 (for FastAPI). Reject any code that alters these without explicit HITL approval.

- **Microservices Adherence:** Maintain separation of concerns: Rust handles orchestration, memory, and watchdog; Python handles RLM logic and skills. No cross-language direct calls outside PyO3 bindings (prep only—do not implement without verification). For self-healing, always generate unit tests in Cargo/Pytest before patching.

- **Safety & Verifiability:** Wrap all outbound calls (e.g., OpenRouter) in Rust's SafetyGovernor. CORE focuses on basic guards only: recursion limits, HITL gates, sanitization. Defer vertical-specific features (e.g., adversarial simulation) post-CORE stabilization; validate edge cases via unit tests.
